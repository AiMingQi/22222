22222.World

## An NFTW Project

22222.World is an 'exclusive club' of members. To be in our club your must own a valid 22222.World NFT. And you have to be down with ColoradoJam!

The website allows new members to purchase different levels of access at different prices and token types on different proof chains.

NFT ownership can be used to unlock different aspects of the 22222.World website. This can include encrypted premium content, access to specialized merchandise sales, private event invites, and membership rewards.

22222.World uses LIT Protocol to generate JWT tokens that allow for advanced authentication, and user token management based on 22222.World token ownership.

In the State of Colorado venues that agree to utilize 22222.World tokens as entry tokens can also validate the identity of the attendee using myColoradoID.

This generates a token that can be recorded with the JWT and a timestamp utilizing Tableland tables to track attendance and also activity within an event. This allows venues to generate a verifiable proof record to meet state compliance requirements while allowing attendees to maintain their privacy.

{ JWT Token + myColoradoID Token + Timestamp } = Private and Secure verification of attendance and ID verification

Tableland allows each venue to generate a unique NFT that represents activity. These tokens can be easily verified, transferred, and even burned. These tables are also extensible to include business functions including serving alcohol, giving access to physical resources, or keeping track of rewards.

22222.World is a new model for all types of organizations to conveniently monetize membership sales, easily verify membership, track attendance and connections, build rewards, and meet any state regulatory demands while completely maintaining the privacy of all participants.

This reduces the regulatory burden on organizations / venues by not requiring them to store (PII) Personal Identifiable Information about any of their users. It offloads that responsibility to the State if it so requires by utilizing digital tokens from APIs like myColoradoID. Venues can easily validate whether a person is over 21 without having to even reveal their name and then securely store that token in a public yet privacy secure manner.

22222.World also empowers the people to maintain their own privacy using tools like Railgun that can keep their wallets private, and gives people the real tools to be in control of their own activity data.
