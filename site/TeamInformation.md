Mitch & Dave worked together on a project at ETHDenver 2020 where we won the InterPlanetary Dao for our integration with Textile.

This year we intend to build some advanced user tracking abilities using Tableland based on Textile. We sincerely appreciate being able to build a project on what we've learned from year's previous.
